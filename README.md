# EcommerceReactReduxNode
This was a class group project to design a eCommerence website based on the restFul Api principles. 
The application uses React, Redux, Redux persist (for session management), Axios, Nodejs, and Mongodb for the fullstack application.
I lead out choosing the libraries and designing the business logic for this website. Below you can see the screens for each web page.
